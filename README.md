# What is that?
Just a small project i've made mostly for myself. As said in the description  it generates random fact from wikipedia using [Mangus Manske's random article tool](https://magnustools.toolforge.org/randomarticle.php) and wikipedia api. For ui PyQt5 package was used.
# How it works
<img width="440" alt="ui" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90620708/161578208-e4216f10-d4fb-4adb-8bf0-256b98f2ad9a.png">
The blue link is clickable and will open the wikipedia page in your browser. The button "More" will generate another fact from one of selected categories. "Add field" will add category written nearby if it exists."Show" will show or hide the category field and the "Remove Selected" button. The latter is for deleting selected categories. "Save" will save url in saved_urls.txt. To open it click "Links" button.
